# Comments:

User stories must be in proper format. “As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”

Organize stories by user role, not component.

Verify all CLIENT-IDEAS are included - the client never said "make me an app that does what the website already does." 

Go back to the RFP, include all ideas from that. 

Go back to your notes from talking with the client - include those.

If not mentioned by the client as important, move those user stories to optional (or possible - do not put them on the prioritized list). 

MVP 1

Grand opening

MVP 2
